# Session Summary – November 27, 2025

## Key Actions Completed
- Initialized local repository in emergent.sh (`/app/dealshaq-prompts`)
- Linked remote repository: `https://github.com/alfredtoussaint-cpu/dealshaq-prompts.git`
- Generated and configured GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication
- Added remote origin and verified connectivity
- Resolved non‑fast‑forward push error by pulling with rebase
- Encountered and resolved merge conflict in `README.md` (kept detailed local version)
- Successfully committed conflict resolution with message: *Resolve README.md merge conflict*
- Completed rebase and pushed changes to GitHub
- Verified that `summaries/testing-seed-summary.md` is now present in the remote repo
- Confirmed updated `README.md` is clean and aligned with project structure

## Current Repository Status
- Remote and local repos are now fully synced
- `summaries/testing-seed-summary.md` available in GitHub
- `README.md` finalized with detailed project overview and workflow instructions
- Workflow established: **Save Work → Save to GitHub → Fork Session → Paste Seed Summary → Run Module Prompts**

## Next Steps
1. Rename `summaries/testing-seed-summary.md` to `summaries/dealshaq-seed-summary.md` for clarity
2. Continue module runs (Retailer App, Consumer App, Admin Dashboard, Backend Services, Frontend Shared Components)
3. After each run:
   - Save Work
   - Save to GitHub
   - Verify file in repo
   - Fork session and re‑seed
4. Maintain session summaries to avoid context loss in emergent.sh
